Hi so, 
today i upload a notebook i did a while ago, i think 2 month ago, where i implemented a versiono of the knapsack 0/1 that use a genetic algorithm approach. 
I think it was a pretty good exercise for me to learn a bit about the GA approach so i thought it would a good idea to upload it, so that's it.
